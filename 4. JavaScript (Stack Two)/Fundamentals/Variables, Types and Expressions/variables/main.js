// Variables

// Variable names follow these rules:

// Variable names are case-sensitive. This means that the message and Message are different variables.
// Variable names can only contain letters, numbers, underscores, or dollar signs and cannot contain spaces. Also, variable names must begin with a letter, an underscore (_) or a dollar sign ($).
// Variable names cannot use the reserved words.
// By convention, variable names use camelcase like message, yourAge, and myName.

// Three types of variables 
// 1. Let - it can be reassigned because it is mutable, Let can be declared globally, but its access is limited to the block in which it is declared
//  2. Var - Var can be declared and accessed globally.
//   3. Const - Once you define a constant, you cannot change its value.
